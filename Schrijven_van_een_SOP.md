1.4 Writing Styles
SOPs should be written in a concise, step-by-step, easy-to-read format. The information
presented should be unambiguous and not overly complicated. The active voice and present verb
tense should be used. The term "you" should not be used, but implied. The document should not
be wordy, redundant, or overly lengthy. Keep it simple and short. Information should be
conveyed clearly and explicitly to remove any doubt as to what is required. Also, use a flow
chart to illustrate the process being described. In addition, follow the style guide used by your
organization, e.g., font size and margins.

        The organization should have a procedure in place for determining what procedures or
processes need to be documented. Those SOPs should then be written by individuals
knowledgeable with the activity and the organization's internal structure. These individuals are
essentially subject-matter experts who actually perform the work or use the process. A team
approach can be followed, especially for multi-tasked processes where the experiences of a
number of individuals are critical, which also promotes “buy-in” from potential users of the SOP.
        SOPs should be written with sufficient detail so that someone with limited experience
with or knowledge of the procedure, but with a basic understanding, can successfully reproduce
the procedure when unsupervised. The experience requirement for performing an activity should
be noted in the section on personnel qualifications. For example, if a basic chemistry or
biological course experience or additional training is required that requirement should be
indicated.
